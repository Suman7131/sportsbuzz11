               <p> The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, in his Mann Ki Baat address aired on August 30, 2020, recognized the vast potential of the Indian gaming industry, applauding the contributions of Indian innovators and application developers. The recent Atmanirbharta challenge also recognized gaming as a category in which the development of indigenous applications is to be encouraged and celebrated. </p>

                <li class="para_batt">Is it legal to play fantasy sports in India?</li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>Fantasy sports are legal, as they are excluded from the ambit of Indian gambling legislations including, the Public Gambling Act of 1867. The Indian Supreme Court in the cases of State of Andhra Pradesh v. K&nbsp;Satyanarayana<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>(AIR 1968 SC 825) and KR Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>(AIR 1996 SC 1153) have held that a game in which success depends predominantly upon the superior knowledge, training, experience, and adroitness of the player shall be classified as a game of skill.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Further, since SportsBuzz11 has a registered office in New Delhi, it is not prohibited by any legislation. It is legal because Fantasy sports is a game of skill and it is protected under the Constitution of India. Also, according to a Court ruling, playing games of skill like Fantasy sports is considered a business activity. Therefore, the activity to play for cash in a game of skill is protected under Article 19[1] (g) of the Constitution of India. Therefore, in our considered view, playing Fantasy sports with cash which is a game of skill is legal subject to the applicability of the taxation policy of the Government. &nbsp;</p>



                <ul>
                    <li class="para_batt">Sikkim, Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Nagaland &amp; Andhra Pradesh</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are various states in India wherein the laws related to the game of skills are unclear. In this regard, for the websites offering online fantasy sports gaming, it remains unclear whether to offer the services for free or not. The Indian states with no clearance regarding the offering of pay-to-play contests include Sikkim, Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Nagaland, and Andhra Pradesh.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this context, SportsBuzz11 does not permit the users identified as the residents of Sikkim, Odisha, Telangana, Assam, Nagaland, and Andhra Pradesh to participate in the pay-to-play contest(s) organized by SportsBuzz11.&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="para_batt">Are fantasy sports a game of skill?&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the online fantasy sports format as a 'game of skill' by its order dated 30th July 2021. Through this order, it dismissed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) that alleged that the Online Fantasy Sports (OFS) format offered an amount to gambling, wagering, and betting and is not a 'Game of Skill'. This reaffirms the judgments passed by the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court and the Bombay High Court and has upheld the judgment passed by the Rajasthan High Court, where the legality of the online fantasy sports format as offered by fantasy sports portals as a 'Game of Skill' was sustained. While deciding on the Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the Hon&rsquo;ble High Court of Rajasthan had declined to entertain it, stating that in the light of orders passed by Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court and Bombay High Court, the matter of gambling has already been put to rest. Hence, the legality of online fantasy sports formats as protected by the Constitution of India is now final by law, and in fact, the&nbsp;Supreme Court also noted that online Fantasy sports and other card games had not been a subject matter of any Court order regarding their legality or otherwise, and hence any challenge pertaining to online fantasy sports offered by such websites was pre-mature.&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="para_batt">Difference between Gambling and Games of Skill</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Gambling or gaming has been defined by the Supreme Court as betting and wagering on games of chance only. The Supreme Court in this judgment specifically excludes games of skill, irrespective of whether they are played for mot le y or not, they are excluded from the definition of gambling. The exact quote from the 1996 judgment is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;The expression 'gaming&rsquo; in the two Acts has to be interpreted in the light of the law laid- down by this Court in the two cases, where it has been authoritatively held that a competition which substantially depends on skill is not gambling. Gambling is the act or practice where stakes are dependent on chance and chance is the controlling factor. 'Gambling' in the two Acts would, therefore, mean wagering or betting on games of chance. &ldquo;It would not include games of skill like horse racing&rdquo; or others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
